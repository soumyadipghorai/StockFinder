"""

expenses = """
**Quarterly/Yearly Expenses** represent the total costs a company incurs over a three-month (quarterly) or twelve-month (yearly) period. These include operating costs, administrative expenses, interest, taxes, and other overheads.

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Profitability Assessment:** Higher expenses reduce net income, directly impacting earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE).
- **Operational Efficiency:** Trends in expenses help evaluate cost control. Investors favor companies that maintain or reduce expenses while growing revenue.
- **Cash Flow Implications:** Rising expenses may signal future cash flow constraints, affecting dividend payouts or reinvestment ability.
- **Margin Pressure:** Increasing costs with stagnant revenue compress profit marginsâ€”potential red flag for investors.

### Using Expense Trends Over Time:

- **Seasonality:** Repeating quarterly patterns can indicate industry seasonalityâ€”important for timing entry/exit.
- **Year-on-Year Growth Rates:** Compare same quarter across years to identify structural growth.

> ðŸ’¡ Cross-reference operating profit trends with revenue growth and cost trends to assess scalability and sustainability.
"""

OPM = """
**Operating Profit Margin (OPM%)** measures a companyâ€™s operating efficiency by expressing operating profit as a percentage of revenue. It's calculated as:

`OPM % = (Operating Profit / Revenue) Ã— 100`

This ratio reflects how much profit a company generates from its core operations before interest and taxes.

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Profitability Indicator:** A consistently high or improving OPM% suggests strong cost control and pricing powerâ€”favorable for long-term investors.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Declining OPM% may signal rising costs, inefficiencies, or competitive pressure, affecting future earnings.

"""

other_income = """
**Other Income** represents revenue earned by a company from non-core business activities such as interest income, dividends, rent, or profit from asset sales. It's listed in the Profit & Loss statement separately from operating income.

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Earnings Quality:** High or fluctuating Other Income may indicate that core operations aren't the main profit driver. Investors prefer stable, operationally driven earnings.
- **Volatility:** Irregular Other Income (e.g., from asset sales) can distort profitability trends, requiring adjustment for a clearer picture.
- **Sustainability:** Persistent non-operating income might not be repeatable. Investors analyze its nature to avoid overestimating future profits.
- **Risk Assessment:** A rising share of Other Income may signal either smart asset utilization or dependence on volatile sources.

### Using Other Income Trends from Charts:

Look for:
- **Consistency:** Stable or steadily rising Other Income could reflect interest or rental incomeâ€”less risky and more predictable.
- **Spikes:** Sudden increases may stem from one-off events. Cross-reference with notes in financial statements.
- **Contribution to Net Profit:** Track the ratio of Other Income to Net Profit over time to gauge dependency.

> ðŸ’¡ Adjust earnings models by excluding volatile Other Income to evaluate core business performance accurately.
"""

interest = """
**Quarterly/Yearly Interest** refers to the interest earned or paid on investments or borrowings over a quarter or year. For fixed-income investments (like bonds or deposits), it's the return earned periodically. For liabilities, it's the cost incurred on borrowed capital.

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Returns Assessment:** Regular interest helps investors compare fixed-income instruments. Higher annualized returns may attract conservative investors.
- **Compounding Frequency:** Quarterly interest compounds faster than yearly, increasing total returns. This is crucial in long-term planning.
- **Cash Flow Planning:** Periodic interest provides liquidity, useful for reinvestment or income needs.

### Using Quarterly/Yearly Interest Trends:

Use the chart to assess:
- **Trend Over Time:** Rising interest suggests improving yield or increasing rates, which may enhance returns.
- **Volatility:** Fluctuating interest rates may signal market instability or central bank interventions.
- **Comparison Across Periods:** Helps determine whether short-term or long-term instruments are performing better.

> ðŸ’¡Check real returns by adjusting for inflation; nominal interest alone may be misleading.
"""

depreciation = """
**Depreciation** is the accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It appears on the income statement and reduces taxable income.

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Earnings Quality:** High depreciation reduces net income but not cash flow, making cash-based metrics (like EBITDA) more reliable for analysis.
- **Asset Efficiency:** Rising depreciation may indicate recent capital investments. Investors check if these investments improve productivity or revenue.
- **Tax Shield:** Depreciation lowers taxable profits, indirectly boosting free cash flowâ€”important for valuing companies via DCF.

### Using Quarterly/Yearly Depreciation Trends:

Look for:
- **Consistent Depreciation:** Suggests stable asset base. Useful for predicting future capital needs.
- **Sudden Spikes:** May indicate new asset purchases or aggressive accounting changes. Cross-verify with CapEx in the cash flow statement.
- **Depreciation vs. Revenue Growth:** If depreciation rises faster than revenue, asset utilization may be inefficient.

tax = """
**Tax % (Quarterly/Yearly)** refers to the effective tax rate a company or investment incurs over a specific period, calculated as:

> `Tax % = (Tax Expense / Pre-Tax Income) Ã— 100`

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Net Profit Impact:** Higher tax rates reduce after-tax profits, directly impacting earnings per share (EPS) and investor returns.
- **Cash Flow Considerations:** Increased tax outflows reduce free cash flow available for reinvestment or dividends.
- **Valuation Sensitivity:** Tax rates influence discounted cash flow (DCF) valuations by altering net income projections.

### Using Tax % Trends from the Chart:

"""

dividend_payout = """
**Dividend Payout %** represents the proportion of a companyâ€™s earnings distributed to shareholders as dividends. It is calculated as:

> `Dividend Payout % = (Dividends / Net Profit) Ã— 100`

### Impact on Investment Decisions:

- **Income vs Growth:** High payout ratio attracts income-focused investors; low ratio signals reinvestment for growth.
- **Sustainability:** Consistent or growing payout indicates stable earnings and management confidence.
- **Risk Indicator:** An unusually high payout (>100%) may signal unsustainable dividends, especially if profits decline.
- **Industry Benchmarking:** Capital-intensive sectors often retain profits; others like utilities may have higher payout norms.

### Using Quarterly/Yearly Dividend Payout % Trends:

| Trend                         | Interpretation                         |
